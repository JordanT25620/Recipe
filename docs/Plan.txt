Recipe Sharing API w/ QR codes
- The app is free and do not need an account UNLESS you are creating a recipe to share.
- It is a WEB APP, but especially designed to fit a phone screen.


Considerations for ui-api sync:
- Registration forms need to set minimum password length to 7 before successful registration.
