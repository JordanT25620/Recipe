Recipe Sharing API w/ QR codes
- The app is free and do not need an account UNLESS you are creating a recipe to share.
- It is a WEB APP, but especially designed to fit a phone screen.


Considerations for ui-api sync:

Do we want users to be able to delete their accounts?
 - Probably not, but if we do allow this, make sure to have a CONFIRMATION POPUP because currently, deleting a User will cascade delete all of their 
    recipes (even if others are using them).
